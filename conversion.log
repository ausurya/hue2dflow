# Workflow YAML Review

I've identified the following discrepancies between the YAML and the original workflow summary:

## 1. WORKFLOW NAME
- **Discrepancy**: The YAML has name "Databricks Workflow" but the original is "sample-java-wf"

## 2. TASK NAMES
- All tasks from the original workflow are present in the YAML

## 3. DEPENDENCIES
- **Missing Dependencies**:
  - "shell-prep" → "fail" (on error) connection is missing
  - "spark-process" → "fail" (on error) connection is missing

The YAML only has success-path dependencies and does not include the error-path dependencies to the "fail" node.

## 4. NOTEBOOK TASK TYPE
- **Discrepancy**: All tasks use "notebook_task" type in the YAML, but the original workflow specifies:
  - "shell-prep" should be a Shell action
  - "spark-process" should be a Spark action
  
The YAML incorrectly treats all tasks as notebook tasks rather than using the appropriate action types for shell-prep and spark-process.

# Workflow YAML Review

I've evaluated the YAML against the original workflow summary and found the following discrepancies:

## 1. WORKFLOW NAME:
✅ The workflow name "sample-java-wf" matches exactly.

## 2. TASK NAMES:
✅ All tasks from the original workflow are present with their exact names:
   - Start
   - shell-prep
   - spark-process
   - fail
   - end

## 3. DEPENDENCIES:
❌ **Discrepancy in dependencies:**
   - Missing error path dependencies:
     - "shell-prep" should connect to "fail" on error
     - "spark-process" should connect to "fail" on error
   - The YAML only shows the success path dependencies:
     - Start → shell-prep
     - shell-prep → spark-process
     - spark-process → end
   - The "fail" task has no dependencies defined, but it should be triggered on error conditions

## 4. NOTEBOOK TASK TYPE:
✅ All tasks correctly use the notebook_task type.

**Recommendation:** Add error handling dependencies to properly reflect the original workflow's error paths to the "fail" task.

# Review of Databricks Workflow YAML

Based on my comparison of the YAML against the original workflow summary, I've identified the following discrepancies:

## 1. WORKFLOW NAME:
✅ The workflow name "sample-java-wf" matches exactly.

## 2. TASK NAMES:
✅ All tasks from the original workflow are present with their exact names:
   - Start
   - shell-prep
   - spark-process
   - fail
   - end

## 3. DEPENDENCIES:
⚠️ **Discrepancy found in dependencies:**
   - The YAML correctly shows "Start" → "shell-prep"
   - The YAML correctly shows "shell-prep" → "spark-process" (on success)
   - The YAML correctly shows "shell-prep" → "fail" (on failure)
   - The YAML correctly shows "spark-process" → "end"
   - The YAML correctly shows "spark-process" → "fail" (on failure)

## 4. NOTEBOOK TASK TYPE:
⚠️ **Discrepancy found in task types:**
   - According to the original summary, "shell-prep" should be a Shell action, not a notebook_task.
   - According to the original summary, "spark-process" should be a Spark action, not a notebook_task.
   - All tasks are currently configured as notebook_task type in the YAML, which doesn't match the task types specified in the original workflow summary.

The dependencies are correctly implemented, but the task types need to be updated to match the original specification.
