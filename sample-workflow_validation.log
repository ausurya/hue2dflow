# Review of Databricks Workflow YAML

Based on my comparison of the YAML against the original workflow summary, I've identified the following discrepancies:

## 1. WORKFLOW NAME:
✅ The workflow name "sample-java-wf" matches exactly.

## 2. TASK NAMES:
✅ All tasks from the original workflow are present with their exact names:
   - Start
   - shell-prep
   - spark-process
   - fail
   - end

## 3. DEPENDENCIES:
⚠️ **Discrepancy found in dependencies:**
   - The YAML correctly shows "Start" → "shell-prep"
   - The YAML correctly shows "shell-prep" → "spark-process" (on success)
   - The YAML correctly shows "shell-prep" → "fail" (on failure)
   - The YAML correctly shows "spark-process" → "end"
   - The YAML correctly shows "spark-process" → "fail" (on failure)

## 4. NOTEBOOK TASK TYPE:
⚠️ **Discrepancy found in task types:**
   - According to the original summary, "shell-prep" should be a Shell action, not a notebook_task.
   - According to the original summary, "spark-process" should be a Spark action, not a notebook_task.
   - All tasks are currently configured as notebook_task type in the YAML, which doesn't match the task types specified in the original workflow summary.

The dependencies are correctly implemented, but the task types need to be updated to match the original specification.
